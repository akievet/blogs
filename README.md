## Welcome to my simple blog.

After a year of promising myself I'll start blogging when... I decided to practice what I preach as an Agile consultant and first make the smallest thing that can possible work. Originally I envisioned creating a beautifully-designed custom-built blog, perhaps in a new language (why not?) and deploying it myself. Good thing I have a mentor who reminded me that my blog is 'absolutely not about building the blog, it's about publishing the contents'. The idea of a minimum viable product (MVP) is delivering the highest value with the mimimum costs, and that is why Github Markdown files will do until the day when my goal is to actually build a blog.
