## Full Stack Fest Review

### Overview

Last week, I attended [Full Stack Fest](http://fullstackfest.com/) in beautiful Barcelona. Full Stack Fest is actually two seperate conferences -- Baruco (Barcelona Ruby Conf), and Future JS -- with a day of workshops in between. There were also 4 nights of sponsored meetups/parties where I got the chance to mingle with international Rubyists and Javascripters.

Disclaimer: this was my first multi-day conference [^1], so I don't have a lot of conference experience off of which to base my opinions. It seemed like most attendees agreed though when I say FSF was superbly-organized.

### Baruco

### Future JS


[^1]: I attended [Goruco](http://goruco.com/), a one day Ruby conference in New York City, earlier this summer.
